                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">
                    In my six years with Ford Credit, I've worked in Collections, Originations, Funding, and Dealer
                    Credit.
                    Currently, I'm an Originations Team Lead, where I oversee a team of consumer credit analysts.
                    I'm also a Mama to three kids, and have been married to a career-soldier
                    for 17 years. I am an avid "maker" and am passionate about finding creative ways to create hand-made
                    versions
                    of everything I can! From woodworking to <a href="/marshmallows.html"> Homemade Marshmallows</a>-
                    I've discovered that, with enough time and research, even the most complicated
                    tasks can be accomplished if you break it down step-by-step.

            <h2>Why I Want to Be a Software Engineer</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">
                As the world economy shifts to a more eCommerce and IT centric workforce, Software Engineers are
                critical to the success of any modern organization.
                A career as a software engineer offers infinite growth potential, along with the ability to effect
                positive change- both internally
                and externally.
                Understanding that the I have only scratched the very surface of coding, I know that this is a field
                that I will be passionate about for the rest of my life.
                My knowledge of the business, commitment to creative problem-solving, and passion for learning will help
                me to
                be successful in this role.

                <em>"According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—a reason for living... Having a strong sense of
                    ikigai—the place where passion, mission, vocation,
                    and profession intersect—means that each day is infused with meaning. It’s the reason we get up in
                    the morning. It’s also the reason many Japanese never
                    really retire (in fact there’s no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in
                    English):
                    They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because they’ve found a real purpose in life—the
                    happiness of always being busy."
