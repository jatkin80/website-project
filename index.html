                    In my six years with Ford Credit, I've worked in Collections, Originations, Funding, and Dealer Credit. 
                    Currently, I'm an Originations Team Lead, where I oversee a team of consumer credit analysts. 
                    I'm also a Mama to three kids, and have been married to a career-soldier 
                    for 17 years. I am an avid "maker" and am passionate about finding creative ways to create hand-made versions
                    of everything I can! From woodworking to <a href="/marshmallows.html"> Homemade Marshmallows</a>- I've discovered that, with enough time and research, even the most complicated
                    tasks can be accomplished if you break it down step-by-step.

                <h2>Why I Want to Be a Software Engineer</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">
                    As the world economy shifts to a more eCommerce and IT centric workforce, Software Engineers are critical to the success of any modern organization. 
                    A career as a software engineer offers infinite growth potential, along with the ability to effect positive change- both internally 
                    and externally. 
                    Understanding that the I have only scratched the very surface of coding, I know that this is a field that I will be passionate about for the rest of my life.
                    My knowledge of the business, commitment to creative problem-solving, and passion for learning will help me to
                    be successful in this role.

                            <em>"According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—a reason for living... Having a strong sense of ikigai—the place where passion, mission, vocation, 
                    and profession intersect—means that each day is infused with meaning. It’s the reason we get up in the morning. It’s also the reason many Japanese never 
                    really retire (in fact there’s no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): 
                    They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because they’ve found a real purpose in life—the happiness of always being busy."
