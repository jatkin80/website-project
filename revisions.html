                I asked my parents for feedback on this website. My dad is a Cobol Programmer with
                40+ years of experience and my mom is a Realtor with an eye for design. <br><br>

    <h2>Home Page- Edit One- "Add Clarity"</h2> <br> <br>

    <ul class="changes">

        <li> Although my mom liked the "Ikigai" venn diagram, she thought it needed to be defined and suggested that I
            include
            a linked explanation of the concept.

        <h2>Marshmallows Page- Edit Two- "Readability"</h2> <br>
        <ul class="changes">
            <li>My mom felt as though the layout of the text reading "240 degrees F" was awkward to read due to the line
                split. I solved that by
                finding, and inserting, the HTML code for degrees.

        <h2 class="revisions">Marshmallows Page- Edit Three- "Update Step Two"</h2> <br>
        <ul class="changes">
            <li>My parents identified that the way Step Two was divided made it read like two different steps in the
                recipe.
                They suggested that I add a sub-bullet, condense into one (clearly-defined) section, or separate into
                two different
                steps. I opted to divide into two steps, to allow the photos to show the vanilla beans and the sugar's
                reaction to heat.

        <h2>Marshmallows Page- Edit Four- "Add a Video"</h2> <br>
        <ul class="changes">
            <li> My dad suggested that I should add a video to the webpage. This was a more challenging
                revision! Although both of my parents agreed that there should be video content, they had different
                opinions on what the
                content of the video should include. (My mom suggested a video of my daughter biting into the
                marshmallow. My dad thought
                it would be good to have a video of me actually making the recipe. You'll notice that neither of those
                ideas made the
                final website, as my kids were in school and I didn't have time to re-make the recipe on the project
                due-date). I settled for videos
                of my mixture running while making the marshmallows! <br></li>
