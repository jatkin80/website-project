    <H1> Vanilla Bean Marshmallows</H1>
    <article>
        <div>

            <p>
                From 2008 to 2014, I was the owner/operator of a small custom bakery. In order to remain profitable,
                during a time when the market was flooded with
                talented cake artists, I had to find ways to make my product stand-out. I specialized in decorated sugar
                cookies and candies and
                found that priortizing the quality of ingredients was the best way to retain business, in spite of the
                competition.
                My homemade marshmallows were one of my best selling products, and one that my friends and family still
                request for holidays and special occasions.
                The process is actually quite simple. Follow along with me as we make some Valentine's Day themed
                Homemade Vanilla Bean Marshmallows!

                    Once you have added all of the syrup, increase the speed to high. Continue to whip until the mixture
                    becomes very thick and the
                    sides of the bowl are lukewarm- approximately 12 to 15 minutes. <br><br>

            <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
            <article>
                <div>

                    <p>Homemade marshmallows will change your world!! Once you've tried them, you'll never go back to
                        store-bought. If you've never liked marshmallows, these are still worth trying! I can't tell you
                        how many of my customers told me "I always hated marshmallows until I tried yours"- they really
                        are <em>
                            that</em> good! <br> <br>
                        I do have a few helpful tips that may help you <em>BEFORE</em> you find yourself staring at a
                        pot of molten sugar
                        and wondering why you decided to trust a test website:
                        <br> <br>
                    <ul class="thoughts">
                        <li>
                            The quality of your ingredients matters! I prefer organic beef gelatin, as it doesn't have
                            the
                            "barnyard" odor that most store-bought gelatins have. Homemade vanilla, and whole
                            vanilla beans, are always preferred; however, if you don't have gallons brewing at all times
                            (and most don't),
                            purchase the highest quality pure vanilla extract you can find. Vanilla bean paste can be
                            substituted for the whole
                            vanilla beans (and will give you the same great vanilla bean "sparkle"). Just add 1-2 TBSP
                            of paste to the mixer
                            when you incorporate the vanilla extract. <br>
                            <br>
                            <div class="recipe">

                            When it comes to cutting/decorating your marshmallows, you are only limited by your
                            imagination! Although
                            most prefer plain or chocolate covered marshmallows, feel free to experiment with any
                            toppings you prefer! Chopped nuts are always a hit, as well! <br>

                            Don't worry about the "waste" when using cookie cutters. The remaining pieces, and/or any
                            "imperfect" cuts can be cut into smaller pieces
                            and will still taste phenomenal! Plus, they're GREAT in hot cocoa! <br>

                            Don't hesitate to use the "fluff" and scraps as bribery! This recipe is fun, and the
                            chemical transformation is mesmerizing
                            but, the dishes and mess are *real*. My kids will commit to just about any chore when bribed
                            with this gooey
                            goodness! <br>
